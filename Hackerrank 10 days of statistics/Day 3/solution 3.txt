Easier Approach:
After drawing the first red marble, we are left with 2 red marbles and 4 blue marbles, so the probability of drawing a second blue marble is: 4 / 6 = 2/3

Complex Approach:
Events:
FR = first red marble
FB = first blue marble
SR = second red marble
SB = second blue marble

Outcomes in experiment:
Total number of outcomes: 2P7 = 7! / (7-2)! = 7 * 6 = 42 
Number of outcomes in event (FR and SB): 3 * 4 = 12

Probability:
P(FR) = 3/7
P(FR and SB) = 12 / 42 = 2/7 

P(SB | FR) = P(SB and FR) / P(FR) 
= P(FR and SB) / P(FR)
= 2/7 / 3/7
= 2/3
